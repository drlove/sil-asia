The event, supported by AeHIN, ADB and WHO lead to the development and identification of concrete plans on how digital health technologies can be deployed and used in the country. One of the key items identified is the need to adopt an international standard that can be used to facilitate health data exchange. The identified standard is the HL7 FHIR standard.\u00a0 The HL7 FHIR standard is a critical tool to ensure the integration of the various digital health solutions that are being deployed\/used in the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integration of these systems for them to work together is needed to ensure that timely and accurate data are available to the HMIS and to ensure that patient care whether in the primary care level or in more specialized levels can be maximized. The integration of these systems can be made possible if they are interoperable and adhere to standards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Asian Development Bank established the Standards and Interoperability Lab &#8211; Asia (SIL-Asia)\u00a0 to serve as a public regional good for digital health expertise.
