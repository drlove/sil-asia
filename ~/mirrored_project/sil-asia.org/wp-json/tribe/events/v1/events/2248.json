The technical support includes capacity development, project collaborations, creation of knowledge materials, and building of communities of practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Health Level Seven International &#8211; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7-FHIR) is the emerging standard in health data exchange and sharing. HL7-FHIR uses the power of the web to exchange data across disparate platforms and technologies. Health Information Exchanges, Hospitals Information Systems, and even large tech companies, such as Google and Apple, are using HL7-FHIR in handling health data. Google Healthcare provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be accessed by EMRs to share data with web applications (and vice versa). One of the standards being used is HL7 FHIR<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Apple uses HL7 FHIR to connect the Apple Health App to various EMRs\/EHRs and even wearables such as the Apple Watch<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the ease of using it, FHIR has driven the development of more health-related applications, outside of the traditional Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) or Electronic Health Records (EHRs) This includes the development of mobile applications or applications based on wearables. HL7-FHIR leverages the use of APIs to improve access to health data being used by different EMRs. Countries around the world, like the United States, Netherlands, and in Asia (Viet Nam, Philippines) are adopting HL7-FHIR to be the baseline standard of their respective health information exchanges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of this workshop is to provide an overview of HL7-FHIR to digital health practitioners in the region. Specifically, the workshop aims to show how HL7-FHIR as a standard can be implemented in national digital health programs. This workshop is being organized by the Standards and Interoperability Lab &#8211; Asia (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sil-asia.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIL-Asia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), which has been established by the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a shared resource in the Asia Pacific Region for capacity building on health standards and interoperability. The lab has been established to provide technical assistance to countries as they develop their digital health infrastructure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Benefits of using HL7 FHIR<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR is based on web standards technologies. This means that any web-based application can easily integrate with FHIR.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR already has a built-in server with an internal database. Implementers only need to create interfaces with the server.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-FHIR provides a plug-and play mechanism for EMRs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple implementation libraries to kickstart development<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specification is free to use<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follows 80 &#8211; 20 rule<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Training Information<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three-day workshop on HL7-FHIR, plenary sessions will be held by invited speakers. Since it is expected to have participants with different backgrounds and levels of knowledge on HL7-FHIR, parallel workshops will also be conducted to ensure that attendees will be able to participate in areas where they are most interested. Finally, the workshop will culminate through a design thinking session. This session aims to identify key workflows or use cases where HL7-FHIR will provide the most value. Participants will be requested to prepare use cases before the workshop (in discussion with program managers and policy makers in their respective countries) to provide the most value to their health systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Learning Outcomes<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this three-day workshop, participants should be able to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appreciate HL7-FHIR as a standard in comparison with other HL7 standards;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations on a FHIR server;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Model health-related workflows and health-related forms using FHIR resources;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement a FHIR server; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify workflows where FHIR can provide value to the countries\u2019 health sector.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Participants<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expected total number of participants will be 30 &#8211; 40. Expected invitees are from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Viet Nam, Myanmar, Indonesia, Taipei-China, and the Philippines. The program is expected to benefit digital health implementers (both those with experience using FHIR and those that are new to FHIR), policy makers, and health practitioners\/clinicians. There will be parallel sessions to ensure that participants may be able to attend an area that will benefit them. An ideation workshop will be done towards the end of the workshop to identify workflows\/specific projects where FHIR can be used in countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Parallel Sessions<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modelling in FHIR<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; This session will focus on how clinical stories can be modelled using FHIR resources.
