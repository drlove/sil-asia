A patient who underwent check-up in a rural health center in the province cannot bring his\/her medical record digitally when he\/she goes to a hospital for further treatment. Because of this, continuity of care cannot be achieved. Also, this leads to redundancy of tests as the tests done in one facility may not be honored in another facility. Implementing an in-country health information exchange (HIE) is challenging due to the absence of a strong infrastructure to support HIE implementation.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"solution-domains-we-appreciate\">Solution domains we appreciate<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solutions&nbsp;which work in low resource setting (offline, occasionally online)<\/li>\n<li>Solutions which network and connect patients and rural health centers to other health organizations<\/li>\n<li>Solutions which offer easier healthcare access, lower price, or better service quality<\/li>\n<li>Customer\/Patient journey apps<\/li>\n<li>Mobile apps and\/or online services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"constraints-\">Constraints:<\/h3>\n<p>Intermittent internet connection should be considered<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"resources\">Resources<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Standards and Interoperability Lab \u2013 Asia<\/strong>&nbsp;(SIL-Asia) will set up a FHIR&nbsp;(<em>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources<\/em>) server that can be used by participants in sending data\/receiving data from other electronic medical records (EMRs).
