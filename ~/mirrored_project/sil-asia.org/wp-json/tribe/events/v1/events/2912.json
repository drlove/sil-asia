As a result, health information systems used by different healthcare providers are still operating in siloes and unable to communicate with one another. Over the years, these siloed systems have been using a wide range of clinical terminologies to define diseases, treatments, operations, and medicines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interoperability cuts across various data layers such as context (semantics), architecture (structure), language (syntax), and presentation (system). With semantics as one of the core foundational elements for health data interoperability, countries should invest in setting up a terminology service for reliable and accurate exchange of data in the national healthcare sector. This would enable the creation of standardized clinical terminology, which would eliminate the need for duplicated efforts and thus, ensure good quality of stored data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address this capacity gap, the Standards and Interoperability Lab &#8211; Asia together with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will organize a series of workshops for the Asia Pacific region on these topics: (1) FHIR Terminology Resources; (2) FHIR Terminology Operations; (3) Mapping of Terminology to Ontoserver; (4) Terminology Content in Ontoserver; and (5) Introduction to SNOMED CT (from SNOMED International).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Objectives<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the series of workshops, the participants will be able to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iscuss <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">primary terminology-related structures and relationships in FHIR resources;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demonstrate how to use FHIR terminology resources to send or receive data from a FHIR repository;\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Map existing terminology into FHIR<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> code systems;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain syndication of terminology content in Ontoserver<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describe the features of SNOMED CT\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><strong>Prerequisites<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior knowledge to FHIR<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Day 2 Topic<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduction to FHIR Terminology Operations<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>","excerpt":"","slug":"ontoserver-training-series-day-2-via-aehin-hour","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2021-03-10 18:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2021","month":"03","day":"10","hour":"18","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2021-03-10 19:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2021","month":"03","day":"10","hour":"19","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2021-03-10 18:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2021","month":"03","day":"10","hour":"18","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2021-03-10 19:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2021","month":"03","day":"10","hour":"19","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"UTC+0","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"suffix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"interoperability","slug":"interoperability","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":10,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":77,"filter":"raw","id":10,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags\/10","collection":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags"}},{"name":"standards","slug":"standards","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":15,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":77,"filter":"raw","id":15,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags\/15","collection":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags"}},{"name":"terminology","slug":"terminology","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":88,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","id":88,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags\/88","collection":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/tags"}}],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Ontoserver Training Series Day 2 via AeHIN Hour","description":"&lt;p&gt;Rationale Most countries in the region do not adopt yet a framework for standards implementation.
