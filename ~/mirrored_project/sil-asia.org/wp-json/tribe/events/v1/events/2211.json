HL7 FHIR can provide an interoperability server that can be used as a layer for PHIE. Furthermore, adopting FHIR would provide DOH with a standard data model that can encourage the development of more standards-based and interoperable information systems. FHIR will also allow interfacility exchange of data. Interfacility health data exchange is one of the foundations of the SDN concept in the Universal Health care bill.\u00a0 SIL-Asia has also piloted the connection of FHIR and DHIS2. If DOH will adapt FHIR, then it can also utilize the connectivity between FHIR and DHIS2 to have a dashboard integrated with PHIE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Rationale\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources) is the emerging standard in health data exchange and sharing. HL7 FHIR uses the power of the web to exchange data across disparate platforms and technologies. Health Information Exchanges, Hospitals Information Systems and even large tech companies like Google and Apple are using FHIR in their handling of health data. Because of the ease of using it, it has driven the development of more health related applications such as mobile personal health records, outside of the traditional EMRs or EHRs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Philippines has just passed the Universal Healthcare Act, and an important component of the Act is on the development of service delivery networks (SDNs) in the whole country. With these SDNs, patients are expected to have a primary care provider, but healthcare should be available anywhere the patient is. For this model to work, it requires that health information systems that are deployed in facilities must easily communicate with one another and share patient data to ensure continuity of care. There are efforts in developing a Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE) with the ultimate goal of allowing exchange of patient data. However, as of the moment, the only available workflow for PHIE is on insurance claims with PhilHealth. The Philippine digital health ecosystem is not yet mature enough to enable meaningful exchange of data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of this symposium is to convene different stakeholders in digital health, introduce to them HL7 FHIR and demonstrate how this new standard can be leveraged to enable interoperable health systems that will empower the SDNs and the Primary Care setup defined in the UHC Law. Invitees include Department of Health, Academe (UP Manila), Science and Technology (ASTI, PCHRD), EMR Providers, Hospitals and Private Sector. Aside from HL7 FHIR, we will be opening up the discussion for a possible establishment of an HL7 FHIR Community of Practice in the Philippines to further advance the possible usage of HL7 FHIR in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Rationale of FHIR<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR is currently the emerging standard in Digital Health. It utilizes web technologies to transfer data between systems. The following are the benefits of using FHIR:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is standards based (i.e. HL7). International information systems in digital health are expected to implement FHIR<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR already provides a data format. EMR developers no longer need to define their own and disparate data formats<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR servers already have integrated databases. Application developers can only concentrate on developing an interface and no longer need to implement the database.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR uses standard web technologies. This makes it usable to EMRs, regardless of the platform on how the EMRs are implemented.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easier to connect to mobile system<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fewer data exchange needed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can easily be adapted by legacy systems because it follows standard web technologies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since FHIR uses web technologies, there is a wide pool of software developers who can implement and integrate with FHIR.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FHIR servers provide a plug and play platform for EMRs. With FHIR servers, EMRs can easily connect to the server and pull out data.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promotes single entry of data<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Workshop Objectives<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are objectives of the symposium<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduce HL7 FHIR to participants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Present the benefits of using FHIR<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demonstrate how FHIR works and how it could be implemented<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discuss how FHIR could be used in the Philippine context.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify privacy issues with FHIR<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Program<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12:30 PM \u2013 1:00 PM \u2013 Registration<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:00 PM \u2013 1:05 PM \u2013 Welcome Remarks, Gerard Servais, Senior Health Specialist, South East Asia Department, ADB<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:05 PM \u2013 1:15 PM \u2013 Opening Remarks: Dr. Raymond Sarmiento, SIL-Asia expert, President HL7 Philippines<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:15 PM \u2013 1:30 PM \u2013 Introduction to AeHIN: Dr. Alvin Sarmiento, Executive Director, AeHIN<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:30 PM \u2013 2:30 PM \u2013 A Quick Look into FHIR: Philip Christian Zuniga, Technical Director SIL-Asia<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM \u2013 FHIR Demonstration: Rose Ann Zuniga, Health Systems Expert SIL-Asia<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:00 PM \u2013 3:30 PM \u2013 Next Steps, Building a Community of Practice: Kristin Chloe Pascual, Communications Manager SIL-Asia<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:30 PM \u2013 4:00 PM \u2013 Open Forum<\/span><\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"fhiring-up-digital-health","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2019-05-24 13:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"05","day":"24","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-05-24 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"05","day":"24","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2019-05-24 13:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"05","day":"24","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-05-24 17:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"05","day":"24","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"UTC+0","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"suffix","values":[]},"website":"www.sil-asia.org","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":450,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2018-08-09 04:18:46","date_utc":"2018-08-09 04:18:46","modified":"2018-08-09 04:18:46","modified_utc":"2018-08-09 04:18:46","url":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/venue\/asian-development-bank\/","venue":"Asian Development Bank","slug":"asian-development-bank","address":"6 ADB Avenue","city":"Mandaluyong City","country":"Philippines","province":"Metro Manila","zip":"1550","stateprovince":"Metro Manila","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Asian Development Bank","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"6 ADB Avenue","addressLocality":"Mandaluyong City","addressRegion":"Metro Manila","postalCode":"1550","addressCountry":"Philippines"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"sil-asia.org?id=450","global_id_lineage":["sil-asia.org?id=450"]},"organizer":[{"id":431,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2018-08-09 03:47:03","date_utc":"2018-08-09 03:47:03","modified":"2018-08-09 03:47:03","modified_utc":"2018-08-09 03:47:03","url":"http:\/\/sil-asia.org\/organizer\/standards-and-interoperability-lab-asia\/","organizer":"Standards and Interoperability Lab &#8211;
