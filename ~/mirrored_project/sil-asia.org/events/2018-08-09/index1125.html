SUMMARY:Health Enterprise Architecture Workshop 2018
DESCRIPTION:Developing a Regional Health Enterprise Architecture Framework and Principles to Enhance Interoperability of Health Information Systems in Asia\nConcept Note as of July 27\, 2018 \n  \nBackground \nCountries need guidance in planning\, designing\, implementing\, and scaling digital health as an established intervention or strategy for universal health care. Based on numerous meetings indicated within this section\, an enterprise architecture (EA) workshop referred to as health enterprise architecture framework or ‘HEAF’ is being planned for August 2018 with the goal of generating a guidance publication for countries. \nAfter training 26 members on HL7 in 2012\, AeHIN discovered that simply having standards (eg\, building blocks) is not sufficient without a blueprint (eg\, enterprise architecture). Recognizing this\, AeHIN conducted two TOGAF certification trainings for 28 members (Ulanbaatar Nov 2013 and Kuala Lumpur April 2014). From these 28\, 12 eventually became certified.  \nAt the Global Health Forum in Manila August 2015\, an Interoperability roundtable was convened by AeHIN and it was agreed that a Regional Enterprise Architecture Council for Health (REACH) be formed from the AeHIN members who were TOGAF certified. REACH would be a shared resource for the region to provide architectural advice. Subsequently\, REACH recommended OpenHIE as a draft Interoperability framework and encouraged members to study its features and share experiences. At the 5th AeHIN GM in Myanmar\, OpenHIE and IHE proponents met for the first time. \nStarting in January 2018\, a series of workshops was planned by ADB and SIL-Asia to support various activities focused on health information exchange standards\, interoperability\, and EA leading up to the 2018 AeHIN General Meeting in Colombo\, Sri Lanka where the outputs will be presented for potential regional implementation. The workshops address the need for capacity building to achieve interoperability\, as well as developing web enabled resource technical capacity for health enterprise architecture principles and framework for regional adoption. The EA will take into account health information systems maturity cycle and the use of new and existing technologies for health such as HL7 FHIR[1]\, blockchain and DHIS2[2].  The HEAF workshop will utilize existing artifact resources[3]\, include outputs from workshops previously held\, and will leverage expert knowledge and best practices. \nMeetings of relevance thus far include: \n\nDuring the February 2018 PMAC[4] held in Bangkok\, Thailand\, a side meeting was convened to finalize the co-creation of the digital health investment guidance jointly developed by ADB and AeHIN[5] member country experts. The purpose of the investment guidance publication is to help governments\, the private sector and the public identify investments in knowledge\, people\, policies and equipment that will maximize the impact of digital health. [6]  During the digital health investment meeting\, it was identified countries require additional guidance in which digital health components to invest in with consideration to prioritizing foundational structures\, data standards\, interoperability and data use. A subsequent meeting was proposed to develop principles for an elaborated Enterprise Architecture (EA) and include representation from the public and private sectors.\nThe concept for the Enterprise Architecture workshop was further elaborated on 26-28 March 2018 when the National Taipei University of Nursing Health Science (NTUNHS) hosted the 2nd Taiwan-AeHIN Health I.T. Collaboration workshop in Taipei\, Taiwan. The Health I.T Collaboration workshop\, was organized by the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN)\, Taiwan Electronic Health Association\, and NTUNHS with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). During the workshop\, AeHIN members reiterated the need to continue and build on the work that has been started during the 2017 AeHIN General Meeting in Nay Pyi Taw\, Myanmar by building capacity and helping each other to develop robust components of each of the identified four main building blocks for the successful interoperability of various health information systems\, namely\, governance\, enterprise architecture\, program management\, and standards.\nIn May 2018\, SIL-Asia organized and hosted\, with support from ADB\, a workshop with Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE[7] a non-profit initiative by healthcare professionals\, sponsored in part by HIMMS[8]) on how to improve health information exchange through coordinated use of established health information technology standards to help address specific clinical needs in support of optimal patient care. During the four-day workshop\, an introduction to IHE\, including insights\, strategies\, common blueprints\, how to write use cases\, profiles and as well as how to test profiles\, were discussed. The workshop included sessions on the health information system needs of member-countries\, specifically Vietnam\, as well as ADB learnings from other countries such as Tonga\, Armenia and Uzbekistan. It also included a session on strategy planning for the AeHIN blockchain demo as well as how SIL-Asia can be established as an IHE Center for Excellence in the future.\nAlso of importance\, this workshop will serve to answer a call by the May 2018 World Health Assembly held at WHO in Geneva Switzerland\, specifically Digital Health Resolution[9] WHA 71.7 agenda item 12.4. Items 4 – 6 call on member States to disseminate\, as appropriate\, best practices and successful examples of digital health architecture\, programmes\, and services\, in particular effective policy design and practical implementation\, with the international community\, including through WHO\, bilateral\, regional\, cross-regional and global networks\, digital platforms and hubs.\nIn June 2018\, SIL-Asia organized a HL7 FHIR workshop held at ADB in Manila that focused on building further health information exchange technical capacity of the SIL-Asia and the Vietnam Ministry of Health eHealth Administration. During that workshop\, it was acknowledged that countries need guidance in developing health information exchange specific architecture (e.g. interoperability layer) that includes data standards and services such as HL7 (FHIR) and integrates with existing architectural components in use in Asia and the Pacific such as DHIS2 and EMRs.To continue this work\, the HEAF workshop will further progress in regional health information technology priorities with a focus on health enterprise business architecture for health information exchange\, data\, specifically for primary point of service/health facility\, insurance support\, national and/or regional infrastructure support\, secondary/tertiary health support\, analytics\, data use\, and public health reporting.\n\n[1] http://www.hl7.org/index.cfm?ref=nav \n[2] https://www.dhis2.org \n[3] https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tl-17-03c?searchterm=maturity+model \n[4] http://pmac2018.com/site \n[5] http://www.aehin.org \n[6] https://www.adb.org/publications/guidance-investing-digital-health \n[7] https://www.ihe.net \n8] https://www.himss.org \n[9] http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA71/A71_R7-en.pdf \n  \nOBJECTIVES \nAt the end of the workshop\, the participants should be able to: \n\nIdentify their country priorities and use cases for health information exchange;\nConsolidate best practices\, challenges\, status from select identified countries\, and other architecture models;\nDescribe the importance of national ID systems;\nDescribe the importance of using standards\, such as HL7 FHIR and terminology;\nDescribe the use and importance of IHE and standards profiles;\nDescribe the value/benefits of health information exchange mechanisms necessary for effective interoperability;\nDescribe the value of looking into the uses of innovative technologies\, including blockchain in the health sector;\nDescribe the value of having a health enterprise architecture for health information exchange –one that is data and data-use driven;\nIdentify the national-level HEAF needs that would be needed to develop a regional HEAF;\nIdentify various health priority use cases for the initial set of HEAF principles;\nDevelop a HEAF for health insurance purposes and HIE involving personal health records;\nDiscuss necessary functional and non-functional requirements of an enterprise architecture that includes security; and\nDiscuss the next steps for HEAF development and pilot testing.\n\n  \nWORKSHOP OUTPUTS \nWorkshop outputs are as follows: \n\nDevelopment of regional health enterprise architecture principles and draft of v1 framework guidance document;\nElaboration of health information exchange (HIE) mechanisms (eg layer) necessary for interoperability that is inclusive of data integration and terminology services;\nDevelopment and submission of regional health enterprise architecture infographics for wider group distribution and review;\nSubmission of paper that takes into account the case studies and lessons learned from various countries\, including Malaysia\, on new\, integrated regional health enterprise architecture principles and framework for interoperability. This will be based on a maturity model approach (low/middle/high income countries with reference to countries health priorities and strategies). The paper will provide key principles for health enterprise architecture framework development for health systems of developing member countries (DMCs) in Asia.\n\n  \n  \nPROGRAM \nDay 1 (August 7): Why’s and How’s of HEAF \n\n\n\nTime\nActivities\nFacilitator\n\n\n8:00-8:10\nWelcome Remarks by ADB\nDonna Mederios\n\n\n8:10-8:20\nWorkshop Objectives\nRaymond Sarmiento\n\n\n8:20-8:30\nPresentation of Existing Resources and Outputs from other Relevant Workshops (HIGAF\, Terminology Guide\, DHIF\, etc.)\nAlvin Marcelo\n\n\n8:30-8:40\nIntroduction to Standards and Interoperabililty Lab – Asia (SIL-Asia)\nPhilip Christian Zuniga\n\n\n8:40-9:00\nMind the GAPS (Governance\, Architecture\, Program Management\, Standards) Framework\nAlvin Marcelo\n\n\n9:00-9:20\nDigital Health Investment Framework (DHIF) Guide\nPhilip Christian Zuniga\n\n\n9:20-10:35\nCountry Priorities and Use Cases\, High Level Best Practices\, and Challenges (including processes at government level that enable their National Health Information Exchange)\nWorkshop\n\n\n10:35-10:45\nBreak\n\n\n\n10:45-11:45\nOverview of TOGAF Foundation\nIryna Roy\n\n\n11:45-13:00\nLunch\n\n\n\n13:00-14:30\nHERA and Other Examples of Enterprise Reference Architecture\nIryna Roy\n\n\n14:30-15:15\nInventory of Existing Systems in Use (DHIS2\, EMRs\, Master Lists\, Registries\, etc.)\nWorkshop\n\n\n15:15-15:30\nBreak\n\n\n\n15:30-16:10\nHIE: Review of Other Principles and Frameworks (HIMSS\, ONC Interoperability Roadmap\, OpenHIE\, HIS Stages of Maturity Model\, WHO-ITU Toolkit (summary)\, HIMMS\, etc)\nAlvin Marcelo\n\n\n16:10-16:40\nHIE: Industry Standards and the IHE Profiles Relying on Them (HL7\, DICOM\, etc) for HIS Interoperability\nIryna Roy\n\n\n16:40-17:00\nHIE: HL7 FHIR for National HIS Interoperability\nRaymond Sarmiento\n\n\n17:00-17:30\nHIE: Demystifying the Health Information Exchange Services/Bus/Interoperability layer\nPhilip Christian Zuniga\n\n\n\n  \n  \nDay 2 (August 8): HEAF Country Experiences and Current Technologies \n\n\n\nTime\nActivities\nFacilitator\n\n\n8:00-8:10\nOverview of Day 2\nRaymond Sarmiento\n\n\n8:10-8:30\nHealth Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (HEAFs): Lessons from AeHIN Member Countries (Philippines)\nRepresentative from the Philippines\n\n\n830-8:50\nHealth Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (HEAFs): Lessons from AeHIN Member Countries (Malaysia)\nRepresentative from Malaysia\n\n\n8:50-9:10\nHealth Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (HEAFs): Lessons from AeHIN Member Countries (Indonesia)\nRepresentative from Indonesia\n\n\n9:10-9:30\nHealth Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (HEAFs): Lessons from AeHIN Member Countries (Viet Nam)\nRepresentative from Viet Nam\n\n\n9:00-9:20\nHEAF Needs of AEHIN Member Countries: Gaps in Current Healthcare Architectures\nPhilip Christian Zuniga\n\n\n9:30-10:35\nCountry Priorities and Use Cases\, High Level Best Practices\, and Challenges (including processes at government level that enable their National Health Information Exchange)\nWorkshop\n\n\n10:35-10:45\nBreak\n\n\n\n10:45-11:45\nNational Health ID\, ID Mapper\, ID Report Recommendations and Country Examples of National ID Systems\nIryna Roy*\n\n\n11:45-13:00\nLunch\n\n\n\n13:00-13:20\nHealth Data Privacy and Security Considerations\nIryna Roy*\n\n\n13:20-14:00\nData Integration and the Use of Data Analytics\nDonna Medeiros\n\n\n14:00-14:30\nBlockchain for Healthcare\nPhilip Zuniga\n\n\n14:30-14:40\nBreak\n\n\n\n14:40-17:30\nWhiteboarding Session: \n– What works well and what should be done differently \n– Building blocks\, user stories for the final report\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n  \nDay 3 (August 9): Future of HEAF \n\n\n\nTime\nActivities\nFacilitator\n\n\n8:00-8:10\nOverview of Day 3\nRaymond Sarmiento\n\n\n8:10-9:00\nDiscussion of Necessary Functional and Non-functional Requirements of a Secured Enterprise Architecture\nIryna Roy\n\n\n9:00-10:45\nRe-visting Health Enterprise Architectures of Countries\nWorkshop\n\n\n10:45-11:45\nLunch\n\n\n\n11:45-13:00\nReview of Requirements for New HEAF\nIryna Roy*\n\n\n13:00-13:15\nIntroduction to Archimate 2.0/3.0\nIryna Roy\n\n\n13:15-15:15\nActivity: \nUsing Archimate Diagramming Techniques for Developing Business Architecture\nIryna Roy*\n\n\n15:15-15:30\nWrap-up\nRaymond Sarmiento\n\n\n\n  \n
