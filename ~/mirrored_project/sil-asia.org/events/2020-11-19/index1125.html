SUMMARY:FHIR DevDays 2020: SIL-Asia Tutorial
DESCRIPTION:Standards and Interoperability Lab – Asia (SIL-Asia) will facilitate a tutorial on ‘Building HL7-FHIR Capability on a Regional Level’ under the ‘FHIR Around the World’ track of FHIR DevDays 2020 on November 19\, 2020 at 2:00 – 2:45 PM PHT/ 7:00 – 7:45 AM CET\nIn this presentation\, we propose to discuss how countries can start developing HL7 FHIR in-country capability. The presentation is focused on discussing the HL7 FHIR starter toolkit that SIL-Asia has been working on. It will also show how the starter toolkit can be adopted by countries. We will also present an HL7 FHIR curriculum that we are using as we organize regional and in-country events. We will share the best practices we have learned and the step-by-step processes we are following in our capacity-building efforts. \nAt the end of the session\, participants should be able to: \n1) develop a detailed plan on how their respective countries can adopt HL7 FHIR \n2) identify key topics that they can use when designing a curriculum for an HL7 FHIR capacity building workshop \n3) design localized learning materials that can be used during the capacity building workshop \nTo join\, register with the FHIR Dev Days Virtual at https://www.devdays.com/november-2020/registration-november/ \n
