SUMMARY:ADB Hack 2018
DESCRIPTION:HACK THE SOLUTIONS FOR RURAL HEALTH ASIA\nChallenge:\nDesign and implement a solution for personal health data sharing and patient journey in a low resource setting! \nIn the Philippines and in many developing countries in Asia\, sharing of patient data from one facility to another is not yet possible. A patient who underwent check-up in a rural health center in the province cannot bring his/her medical record digitally when he/she goes to a hospital for further treatment. Because of this\, continuity of care cannot be achieved. Also\, this leads to redundancy of tests as the tests done in one facility may not be honored in another facility. Implementing an in-country health information exchange (HIE) is challenging due to the absence of a strong infrastructure to support HIE implementation. \nSolution domains we appreciate\n\nSolutions which work in low resource setting (offline\, occasionally online)\nSolutions which network and connect patients and rural health centers to other health organizations\nSolutions which offer easier healthcare access\, lower price\, or better service quality\nCustomer/Patient journey apps\nMobile apps and/or online services\n\nConstraints:\nIntermittent internet connection should be considered \nResources\nStandards and Interoperability Lab – Asia (SIL-Asia) will set up a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) server that can be used by participants in sending data/receiving data from other electronic medical records (EMRs). RESTful API services will be made available by SIL-Asia. FHIR standards will be used for health data messaging. \nPLS are available at our own FHIR server: (http://45.79.142.80) \nIf you are interested to solve this challenge\, go to the official ULTRAHACK ADB Hack 2018 web page or email us at sil-asia@aehin.net \n  \n
